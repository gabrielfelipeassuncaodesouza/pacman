# Pacman Clone

A simple clone of classic Arcade game: Pacman. The game was written in C when I start to learn programming. I made this game about 2019, but I only have update it for here (Github) a good time later because, it that time, I didn't know coding versionment systems like git. So, the age of this repository is not the real age of the game lol.

I intend to improve the game, mainly refactor the code and improve the GUI, as well adding a simple ranking system in the game.

Thanks for visiting :smile:
